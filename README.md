# simon-memory-game
An implementation of the Simon memory game using JavaScript and jQuery.

My take on the tutorial by LondonAppBrewery.
There are certain things that I have changed here.
1) used click event instead of keypress to start the game
2) made functionality to check the answer before playing sound to remove double sound on a wrong answer
3) changed delay time
